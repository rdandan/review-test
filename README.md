# Introduction of Review Mirror

ReviewMirror is a website tool to help users to gain insightful information from reviews as well as to detect product on e-commerce sites which has fake reviews.

We create a review mirror website solution that will use a machine learning model to identify products with deceptive reviews, provide summary points of reviews, and provide other important insights from reviews.

## Current Features

1. Analysing Reviews: you can copy and paste a review from amazon or other platforms to analyse review function and the website will show whether this review is generated by computer or written by human
2. Information: you can get more knowledge about how to identify fake reviews at information page
3. Offer a summary of product reviews via a wordcloud when the user enters the product's link from the Amazon.AU website. Additionally, we provide a wordcloud that displays the most frequently used positive and negative words in product reviews, giving users a sense of the product's pros and cons based on consumer feedback. Moreover, our Ml model will filter out any possible phoney reviews for the provided product link and deliver a recalculated star rating after the bogus reviews are filtered out.
